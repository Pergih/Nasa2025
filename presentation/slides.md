## Slide 1: Hook (30 seconds)
### 👁️ **The Human Eye Problem**

**"Human eyes can only see 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum"**

🌈 **Visible Light**: 400-700 nanometers  
🌌 **Universe**: Radio waves to gamma rays  

**NASA Challenge: "Embiggen Your Eyes"**
> Help people see beyond what their eyes can naturally perceive

**Our Solution: StellarEye**
*Interactive space exploration through satellite perspectives*

## Slide 2: The Challenge (30 seconds)
### 🎯 **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

**"Help people see beyond what their eyes can naturally perceive using satellite data"**

#### The Problem:
- 🚫 Humans can't see infrared, radio waves, X-rays
- 🚫 No way to experience how satellites actually observe space
- 🚫 Complex astronomical data is hard to understand

#### Our Approach:
- ✅ Give users "satellite eyes"
- ✅ Make multi-wavelength vision interactive
- ✅ Use real NASA/ESA mission data
