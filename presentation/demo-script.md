## ðŸŽ¬ **Demo Script (120 seconds)**

### **Opening (10 seconds)**
*[Screen shows StellarEye map view]*

**"Let me show you how StellarEye gives people satellite eyes. This is our interactive space map using real astronomical survey data from ESO - the same data satellites collect."**

### **Part 1: Multi-Wavelength Vision (30 seconds)**

**Action**: Click background dropdown, switch from "DSS Optical" to other surveys

**Script**: *"Watch what happens when we switch from optical light - what human eyes see - to other wavelengths that only satellites can detect."*

*[Switch between different surveys]*

**"Each survey shows the same sky but reveals different phenomena. The ESO optical survey shows stars as we'd see them, while other wavelengths reveal hidden structures and cosmic phenomena that are invisible to human eyes."**

### **Part 2: Object Exploration (40 seconds)**

**Action**: Switch back to "ESO Optical", search for "Jupiter"

**Script**: *"Let's explore a specific object. I'll search for Jupiter..."*

*[Click on Jupiter marker]*

**"Notice how the system automatically loads real mission data. These aren't stock photos - this is actual data from NASA missions."**

**Action**: Click "View X Images" button to switch to gallery

**"Now we can see Jupiter through different satellite eyes - Voyager, Cassini, and other missions. Each image shows different aspects that satellites can capture."**

### **Part 3: Advanced Image Viewer (30 seconds)**

**Action**: Click on a Jupiter image to open it in the viewer

**Script**: *"Our advanced image viewer lets you explore these detailed mission images."*

**Action**: Scroll to zoom in, drag to pan around the image

**"Scroll to zoom, drag to pan. Here we can see Jupiter from different mission perspectives - Voyager's Great Red Spot discovery, Juno's polar cyclones, infrared heat signatures, and Hubble's aurora observations."**

**Action**: Click "Fit" button, then "Full" for fullscreen

**"Perfect for classroom use or detailed exploration."**

### **Closing (10 seconds)**

**Action**: Exit fullscreen, return to map view

**Script**: *"This is how we embiggen human eyes - giving everyone the ability to see the universe like NASA satellites do, with real mission data and an intuitive interface."*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Demo Points to Emphasize**

### **Multi-Wavelength Vision:**
- "Same sky, different satellite perspective"
- "See what human eyes cannot"
- "Real survey data from space missions"

### **Real NASA Data:**
- "Actual mission images, not stock photos"
- "Direct from NASA archives"
- "Professional astronomical accuracy"

### **Educational Value:**
- "Perfect for classrooms"
- "Learn by experiencing"
- "Understand why we need satellites"

### **User Experience:**
- "Intuitive Google Maps-style interface"
- "Advanced image viewing capabilities"
- "Accessible to everyone"

## ðŸš¨ **Backup Plans**

### **If Internet is Slow:**
- Focus on pre-loaded objects (Sirius, Vega)
- Use fallback SVG images to show functionality
- Emphasize the offline capability

### **If Images Don't Load:**
- "This demonstrates our fallback system"
- Show the procedural SVG generation
- Explain the robust error handling

### **If Demo Crashes:**
- Have screenshots ready on slides
- "This shows the power of our caching system"
- Continue with static demo using screenshots

## ðŸŽ¤ **Demo Narration Tips**

### **Voice and Pace:**
- **Speak clearly and enthusiastically**
- **Pause for visual changes** - let the audience see
- **Use "we" language** - "We can see how..."
- **Point out specific features** - "Notice the..."

### **Interaction:**
- **Narrate your actions** - "I'm clicking on..."
- **Explain what's happening** - "The system is loading..."
- **Highlight the wow moments** - "Look at this incredible detail..."

### **Technical Confidence:**
- **Know your data sources** - "This is from the Gaia mission..."
- **Explain the significance** - "This wavelength reveals..."
- **Show expertise** - "The coordinates are precise to..."
