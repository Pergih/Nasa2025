# 🐍 Legacy Python/Dash Implementation

This folder contains the original Python/Dash implementation of the Celestial Explorer. While functional, it was migrated to a modern React stack for better performance and user experience.

## What's Here

- **Python/Dash Frontend**: Interactive celestial map using Plotly
- **NASA API Integration**: Real connections to SkyView, Exoplanet Archive, JPL Horizons
- **Image Processing**: Multi-wavelength astronomical image handling
- **Google Maps-style UI**: Attempted recreation of familiar map interactions

## Key Achievements

✅ **Real NASA Data**: Successfully integrated multiple NASA APIs  
✅ **Image Loading**: Fetched actual astronomical images from NASA SkyView  
✅ **Multi-wavelength Views**: Optical, infrared, X-ray, radio perspectives  
✅ **Satellite Tracking**: Live position updates for space telescopes  
✅ **Search Functionality**: Find stars, galaxies, satellites, exoplanets

## Why We Migrated

While this implementation successfully demonstrated NASA API integration, we encountered limitations:

- **Performance**: Plotly not optimized for map-like interactions
- **Smooth Panning**: Coordinate system felt clunky
- **Mobile Experience**: Limited responsiveness
- **Scalability**: Would struggle with large datasets
- **Modern UX**: Hard to achieve Google Maps-like smoothness

## Running the Legacy Version

```bash
cd legacy
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

## Key Learnings

This implementation proved that:
- NASA APIs are accessible and provide rich data
- Real astronomical images can be fetched and processed
- Python is excellent for data processing and API integration
- Complex astronomical calculations work well in Python/Astropy

These learnings informed the modern React implementation, where Python handles the backend API processing while React provides the smooth frontend experience.
