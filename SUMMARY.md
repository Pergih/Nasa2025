# 🌌 StellarEye - Complete Build System

## 🎉 **What We've Built**

A complete, professional build system for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 project that rivals the original Python app but with modern architecture.

### **🚀 One-Command Development**
```bash
./dev_stellareye.sh  # Everything just works!
```

### **📋 Complete Script Suite**

| Script | Purpose | What It Does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `./dev_stellareye.sh` | **🌟 Main development** | Build + run everything with hot reload |
| `./stellareye.sh` | **🎯 Interactive menu** | Choose what to do with a friendly interface |
| `./build_stellareye.sh` | **📦 Setup only** | Install all dependencies |
| `./run_stellareye.sh` | **🏃 Run only** | Start services (after building) |
| `./test_stellareye.sh` | **🧪 Verify setup** | Test everything works |
| `./build_production.sh` | **🏭 Production** | Build for deployment |
| `./backend.sh` | **🐍 Backend only** | Just the FastAPI server |
| `./frontend.sh` | **⚛️ Frontend only** | Just the React app |

### **📦 NPM Integration**
```bash
npm run dev        # Same as ./dev_stellareye.sh
npm run build      # Same as ./build_stellareye.sh
npm run start      # Same as ./run_stellareye.sh
npm run test       # Same as ./test_stellareye.sh
```

## 🔥 **Key Features**

### **🛡️ Bulletproof Setup**
- ✅ **Dependency Checking** - Verifies uv, npm, Node.js, Python versions
- ✅ **Port Management** - Detects conflicts, suggests alternatives
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Clear messages when things go wrong

- ✅ **Production Ready** - Separate build for deployment
- ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and help
- ✅ **Testing** - Automated verification of setup

## 🌐 **Access Points**

When running, your app is available at:
- **🎯 Frontend:** http://localhost:5173 (or 3000 if 5173 is busy)
- **🔧 Backend API:** http://localhost:8000
- **📚 API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/docs
- **💚 Health Check:** http://localhost:8000/health

## 🆚 **Comparison with Legacy Python App**

| Feature | Legacy (Dash) | Modern (StellarEye) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Startup** | `python main.py` | `./dev_stellareye.sh` |
| **Dependencies** | Manual pip install | Automated with uv |
| **Hot Reload** | Basic | Full stack |
| **Error Handling** | Limited | Comprehensive |
| **Production** | Development only | Production builds |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Complete guides |
| **Testing** | None | Automated tests |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic | Microservices |

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **First Time Setup**
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd stellareye
./dev_stellareye.sh
# That's it! Everything is running
```

### **Daily Development**
```bash
./dev_stellareye.sh
# Edit code, see changes instantly
# Ctrl+C to stop when done
```

### **Testing Changes**
```bash
./test_stellareye.sh
# Verifies everything still works
```

### **Production Deployment**
```bash
./build_production.sh
# Creates optimized builds
# Deploy frontend/dist/ and backend/
```

### **Troubleshooting**
```bash
./stellareye.sh
# Interactive menu helps you choose what to do
```
